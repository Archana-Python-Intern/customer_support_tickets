Project Overview

This project implements an automated workflow for handling customer support tickets. It standardizes raw ticket data by preprocessing and cleaning textual fields, identifies the nature of customer issues through rule-based classification, and assigns appropriate priority levels. Based on priority, the system computes Service Level Agreement (SLA) timelines and determines precise ticket resolution deadlines.

Key Features

Text preprocessing and normalization of support ticket content

Rule-driven categorization of customer issues

Priority assignment based on issue severity

Automated SLA hour calculation

Due-date and due-time generation for each ticket
